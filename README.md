## New Here? Start Here!

**Welcome to the V3 Enterprise Edition.** This isn't just a list of scripts; it's a complete operating system for your AI Agent.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

AI Agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini) are smart, but they lack **specific tools**. They don't know your company's "Deployment Protocol" or the specific syntax for "AWS CloudFormation".
**Skills** are small markdown files that teach them how to do these specific tasks perfectly, every time.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (The "Bundle" Way)

Don't install 250+ skills manually. Use our **Starter Packs**:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
    ```
2.  **Pick your persona** (See [docs/BUNDLES.md](docs/BUNDLES.md)):
    - **Web Dev?** use the `Web Wizard` pack.
    - **Hacker?** use the `Security Engineer` pack.
    - **Just curious?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **[Read the Full Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)**
